He considers four Eblaite women who fullfilled this role during the age of the Archives: Tirīn-damu, Tinīb-dūrum, Tarib-damu, and Amaga. The author analytically collects and presents evidence concerning these women: all were royal daughters, although a few passages suggest a few DAM.DINGIR belonged to the viziers' family (such as~\emph{ti-a-bar-zu}\textsubscript{2}). In the closing remarks, Archi concludes that all priestesses were connected to the city of Luban and the cult of god ʾ\emph{a}\textsubscript{5}(NI)-\emph{da-bal}\textsubscript{(x)}.

In addition, Archi also takes into cosideration~\emph{ti-ne-ib}\textsubscript{2}-\emph{du-rum}'s consecration as priestess (DAM.DINGIR). After a detailed analysis of the gifts delivered on these occasions, Archi concludes that upon their deaths women received the same set of garments and jewels delivered to them on the occasion of their weddings. He further proceeds describing the full set of garments and jewels generally delivered to high ranking women upon these occasions. He then investigated the gifts generally brought by the deceased to their ancestors, and concludes with a few remarks on the wailing rite.
